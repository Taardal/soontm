# SoonTM

App that shows upcoming movies from [The Movie Database][tmdb] in a gallery view. Each movie can be opened in a detailed view that shows the release date, language, story summary and a link to the trailer.

The app is written in [React Native][react-native] with [Redux][redux] for state management, and [Jest][jest] and [Enzyme][enzyme] for testing. 

Components are written with the [Container component][reactpatterns:container] pattern in mind.
